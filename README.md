### Main Features of the Application:
- Main functionalities are: add employee, delete employee, list all employees and update an employee.

### Motivation
- The project motivation is based on personal interest, I'm experienced in developing MERN stack website and I have strong interest in developing back end server with relational database. So I kept my strength in developing front end UI with React, and also developed a full CRUD backend server with Spring Boot and connected it to MySql database.

### Future Version
- Pagination and sorting.
- Authentication with Spring security
